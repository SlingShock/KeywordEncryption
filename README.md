# KeywordEncryption
A custom encryption/decryption algorithm based off of the Vigen√®re cipher. 
Can encrypt letters (lower or uppercase), numbers, symbols, and spaces. 

How it Works: 
1. Run the code.
2. Choose to generate a random keyword or create your own (a).
2a. If you chose to create your own keyword, enter a keyword of any length. You can use any letters, numbers, or symbols.
3. The code will output the plaintext, keyword, and encrypted text. As a test, the code will also try to decrypt the encrypted text using the keyword and display the ciphertext.
